# Spec/FR Completion Gap Audit 2026-05-04

## Summary

- **Kitty specs audited**: 50 (including `archive` directory)
- **Non-archive specs**: 49
- **Completion drift detected**: 6 specs claim COMPLETED/CANCELLED status without tasks.md (eco-series + 013), 3 high-priority specs with significant remaining work
- **Missing artifacts**: 22 kitty spec directories missing plan.md, 14 missing tasks.md entirely; 68 repo-root FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md or PLAN.md files found with no linked tasks tracking

---

## Critical Gaps (Claimed Complete But Actually Incomplete or Unverifiable)

### 1. `013-phenotype-infrakit-stabilization` -- CANCELLED but tasks.md shows 0/56 done

- **Path**: `kitty-specs/013-phenotype-infrakit-stabilization/`
- **Claim**: Status line says `CANCELLED 2026-04-26`, superseded by Phase 1 libification
- **Gap**: tasks.md has 56 unchecked tasks (`[ ]`) -- none marked done despite cancelation. Spec says work folded into spec 021, but no migration evidence in 021's tasks.
- **Risk**: 56 orphaned unchecked tasks; no indication which were actually completed before cancellation
- **No implementation files** in spec directory

### 2. `eco-001-worktree-remediation` through `eco-006-governance-sync` -- All claim COMPLETED with zero tasks evidence

- **Path**: `kitty-specs/eco-001/` through `eco-006/`
- **Claim**: Each spec.md has `state: COMPLETED` and `plan_status: NOT_REQUIRED`
- **Gap**: None have tasks.md or plan.md. Only artifact is `meta.json`. Cannot verify what was actually done.
- **Note**: These may legitimately be small ops tasks, but the lack of any task trace makes completion unverifiable
- **eco-003-circular-dep-resolution**: Internally contradictory -- frontmatter says `State: specified` while body says `state: COMPLETED`

### 3. `021-polyrepo-ecosystem-stabilization` -- P0 critical, only 11% done

- **Path**: `kitty-specs/021-polyrepo-ecosystem-stabilization/`
- **State**: `specified` (not claimed complete)
- **Tasks**: 28 done / 226 remaining = **11% complete**
- **Plan**: Has plan.md with 22 milestone items
- **Implementation**: No implementation files in spec directory
- **Concern**: P0 critical spec with highest task count (254 total), massive scope, no impl artifacts
- **High-risk**: Spec claims to orchestrate 4-phase stabilization of 247 repos; current state suggests early-phase work only

### 4. `001-spec-driven-development-engine` -- 94% done but ambiguous remaining scope

- **Path**: `kitty-specs/001-spec-driven-development-engine/`
- **Status**: `Draft` (not claimed complete)
- **Tasks**: 150 done / 9 remaining = **94.3% complete**
- **Plan**: Has plan.md
- **Implementation**: Has implementation files present
- **Remaining 9 tasks**: Last visible tasks show WP04 (Domain Model -- Governance & Audit) appears to be partially unchecked; tasks.md ends mid-WP at line 169 suggesting file is truncated or more content follows
- **Risk**: High -- this is the foundational spec for AgilePlus; remaining governance/audit WP is security-critical

### 5. `003-agileplus-platform-completion` -- 100% tasks done, but is platform actually complete?

- **Path**: `kitty-specs/003-agileplus-platform-completion/`
- **Status**: `Draft` (despite 100% task completion)
- **Tasks**: 120 done / 0 remaining = **100% complete**
- **Plan**: Has plan.md
- **Implementation**: Has implementation files present
- **Concern**: All checkboxed tasks marked done despite spec status remaining "Draft". The spec describes production-ready platform with Plane.so sync, web dashboard, multi-device sync -- these are not verified as shipped. **Task completion does not match observable platform state** (AgilePlus Rust workspace member crates are scaffolding-only per CLAUDE.md: "no `.rs. files yet")

## Incomplete but Honest (Correctly Marked WIP)

These specs accurately reflect their in-progress state with no completion claim drift:

| Spec ID | Tasks Done | Tasks Total | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `004-modules-and-cycles` | 0 | 38 | Early stage, has all three artifacts |
| `008-temporal-deployment-workflow-migration` | 0 | 24 | No impl files |
| `012-github-portfolio-triage` | 0 | 33 | 4 milestones in plan, no impl |
| `015-plugin-system-completion` | 2 | 49 | 4% complete, no impl |
| `017-cli-tools-consolidation` | 2 | 73 | 3% complete, no impl |
| `018-template-repo-cleanup` | 12 | 54 | 22% complete |
| `019-private-repo-catalog` | 0 | 55 | Not started |
| `020-portfolio-and-web-apps` | 0 | 58 | 5 milestones, no impl |
| `022-batch13-repo-remediation` | 0 | 18 | No plan.md |

---

## Missing Spec Artifacts

### Kitty Specs Missing plan.md (have tasks but no plan)

| Spec ID | Task Count | Done | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| `022-batch13-repo-remediation` | 18 | 0 | No plan at all |
| `012-github-portfolio-triage` | 33 | 0 | Has plan, no impl |
| `eco-012-orgops-capital-ledger` | 48 | 0 | No plan |

### Kitty Specs Missing tasks.md Entirely (plan exists but no task tracking)

- `codeprojects-archive-manifest`
- `feature-specification-template-platform-completion`
- `kooshapari-stale-repo-triage`
- `phenosdk-decompose-core`
- `phenosdk-decompose-mcp`
- `phenosdk-fix-notimplemented`
- `phenosdk-sanitize-atoms`
- `phenosdk-wave-a-contracts`
- `portfolio-audit-kooshapari-2026`

### Kitty Specs With Only spec.md (no plan, no tasks, no impl)

These are spec-only stubs -- valid for early stage but cannot be tracked:

- `deps-bump-postcss-vite`
- `helioscli-rmcp-client-sdk-fix`
- `oci-lottery-daemon`
- `oci-post-acquire-hooks`
- `phenosdk-decompose-llm`
- `snyk-phase-1-deploy`
- `thegent-dotfiles-consolidation`

### Empty Task Files (tasks.md exists but has zero parseable tasks)

- `014-observability-stack-completion` -- spec.md and plan.md exist, tasks.md is empty
- `016-agent-framework-expansion` -- spec.md and plan.md exist, tasks.md is empty
- `consolidate-cache-adapter-crate`
- `consolidate-event-sourcing-crate`
- `consolidate-policy-engine-crate`
- `consolidate-state-machine-crate`
- `tracera-core`
- `byteport-core`, `chatta-core`, `cliproxyapi-plusplus-core`, `helioscope-core` -- 0/8 tasks done

### Repository Root FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md / PLAN.md Without Linked Tasks

68 repositories have root-level spec/plan documents. Most have **no linked tasks.md at all**, making completion state entirely untrackable at the repo level. Notable examples:

- `AtomsBot` -- has both FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md and PLAN.md, no tasks
- `thegent` -- has both FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md and PLAN.md, no tasks
- `pheno`, `phenoForge`, `phenoShared`, `phenoXdd`, `phenoDesign` -- FR+PLAN but no tasks

### TheGent `docs/changes/` Research Specs

Most research change directories lack spec.md and plan.md entirely -- only tasks.md where it exists. Outstanding research work with unchecked tasks:

| Change Dir | Done | Total | Status |
|------------|------|-------|--------|
| `research-cross-platform-coordination` | 0 | 92 | Not started |
| `research-cross-platform-isolation` | 0 | 106 | Not started |
| `research-cross-platform-shell` | 0 | 194 | Not started |
| `research-economic-governance` | 18 | 99 | 18% |
| `research-hook-rust-phase1` | 7 | 87 | 8% |
| `research-idea-seed-system` | 23 | 151 | 15% |
| `research-library-cache` | 0 | 84 | Not started |
| `research-library-retry` | 3 | 130 | 2% |
| `research-maif-artifacts` | 0 | 59 | Not started |
| `research-pareto-routing` | 18 | 113 | 16% |
| `research-simulation-replay` | 0 | 103 | Not started |
| `research-supermemory-integration` | 0 | 103 | Not started |
| `research-tui-compositor` | 2 | 142 | 1% |

Completed (100% tasks done):
- `cli-dag-extraction` -- 6/6 done
- `mcp-server-extraction` -- 4/4 done

## High-Priority Spec Deep Findings

### `001-spec-driven-development-engine` (Spec-Driven Dev Engine)
- **94.3% tasks complete (150/159)** -- remaining 9 tasks guard the governance/audit domain model (WP04)
- Implementation files exist in spec directory
- Status still says "Draft" -- appropriately not claimed complete
- **Risk**: WP04 domain model is security-critical (hash-chained audit logs, evidence linking, policy evaluation); tasks.md may be truncated at line 169

### `003-agileplus-platform-completion` (Platform Completion)
- **100% tasks complete (120/120)** -- yet spec status says "Draft"
- **Major discrepancy**: Tasks all marked done, but AgilePlus Rust workspace has no production code (per CLAUDE.md: scaffolding only, `.rs files yet`)
- Tasks may represent planning/documentation work rather than implementation delivery
- **Recommend**: Reclassify as "integration testing" phase rather than marking all implementation as done

### `021-polyrepo-ecosystem-stabilization` (PolyRepo Stabilization)
- **11% tasks complete (28/254)** with no impl files
- P0 critical cross-repo spec with 22 milestones
- 226 remaining tasks is the largest open gap in the kitty-specs
- Depends on `012-github-portfolio-triage`, `013-phenotype-infrakit-stabilization (CANCELLED)`, and eco-001/002 -- deps 012 is 0% done, 013 is cancelled with orphaned tasks
- **Blocked by dependencies** that are themselves incomplete or cancelled

---

## Recommendations

1. **Eco-series (001-006)**: Add tasks.md retroactively showing what was actually completed, or mark as `ARCHIVED` rather than `COMPLETED` since there's no evidence trail.

2. **013-phenotype-infrakit-stabilization**: Either close remaining 56 tasks with justification or migrate them into spec 021's task list with proper traceability.

3. **003-agileplus-platform-completion**: Re-examine the 120 "done" tasks -- if they represent scaffolding/docs rather than the described production platform (Plane sync, web dashboard, event sourcing, multi-device), split into "platform scaffolding" (done) and "platform services" (not started) work packages.

4. **021-polyrepo-ecosystem-stabilization**: Break 254 tasks into phased milestones with clear ownership; at 11% after presumably weeks of work, the velocity suggests this is a multi-month effort that needs dependency unblocking first.

5. **001 remaining WP04**: Verify whether tasks.md is truncated; if so, enumerate remaining governance/audit tasks and mark clearly which WPs remain.

6. **thegent docs/changes research specs**: 11 research tracks at 0-18% completion with no spec.md -- these are effectively invisible. Either archive inactive tracks or promote active ones to kitty-specs with proper artifact sets.

7. **Repo-root FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md (68 repos)**: None have linked task tracking. Consider adopting AgilePlus spec-kitty workflow for any repo where active development is planned.
