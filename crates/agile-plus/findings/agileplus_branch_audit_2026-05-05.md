| `cherry-mech-7` | 0 | Behind main by 3 commits; no ahead commits |

---

## KEEP — Ahead of main, unique unmerged commits

## KEEP — Gone Upstream (remote branch deleted)

These branches have a `[gone]` upstream marker meaning the tracking branch no longer exists on the remote. However, they still contain unique commits not in `main`. Do NOT delete unless you confirm the work is fully merged.

| Branch | Ahead | Behind main | Tracking Remote (gone) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chore/cargo-deny-fix-tonic-2026-05-04` | 3 | 2 | `origin/chore/cargo-deny-fix-tonic-2026-05-04` |
| `chore/container-base-bump` | 2 | 25 | `origin/agileplus/feat/docs-lockfile-update` |
| `chore/pin-github-actions-20260430` | 4 | 4 | `origin/agileplus/feat/docker-shas` |
| `fix/dependabot-agileplus-high` | 1 | 165 | `origin/agileplus/fix/high-dep-alerts` |
| `fix/duplicate-stream-route` | 1 | 82 | `origin/agileplus/fix/dashboard-route` |
| `spec/014-plan-tasks` | 1 | 83 | `origin/agileplus/spec/014-plan-tasks` |

## Pruning Action Taken

Only `cherry-mech-7` qualifies for deletion as it is fully merged into `main` with zero unique commits.

```bash
git branch -D cherry-mech-7
```

**Final branch count after pruning: 97 (down from 98)**

---

## Notes

- `agile-fix-wt` is ahead of main by 42 unique commits and behind by 3. Explicitly kept per instruction.
- No force-push operations were performed.
- No branch content was modified — only listing and analysis.
- Many branches are 169+ commits behind main, indicating long-stale work that may warrant future review or rebase.
