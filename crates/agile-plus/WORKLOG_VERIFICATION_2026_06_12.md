# Worklog subcommand verification — 2026-06-12

End-to-end verification of `agileplus-cli worklog {schema,list,validate,convert}`
against the 5 focus repos. Performed per the task brief: cargo test, cargo
clippy, and live binary execution.

## Scope

- Repo: `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/AgilePlus`
- Crate: `agileplus-cli` (`crates/agileplus-cli/src/commands/worklog.rs`,
  273 lines, 4 subcommands)
- Binary: `/Users/kooshapari/.cargo/bin/agileplus-cli` (agileplus 0.1.0)
- Focus repos (5): `AgilePlus`, `PhenoCompose`, `nanovms`, `PlayCua`,
  `BytePort`
- Branch context: `feature/agileplus-sota-wraps-cleanup-2026-06-12` (not a
  worktree — main repo checkout). Local `main` does not exist; `origin/main`
  is at `4d3df6906` (P0 closure of FR-024 trace validator), which is several
  commits behind the current branch. The report is committed to the current
  branch.

## 1. `cargo test -p agileplus-cli --offline`

Result: **PASS** — all 45 tests pass, 0 failures.

```
running 45 tests
... 45 ok lines ...
test result: ok. 45 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 4.78s
```

Notable: `worklog.rs` itself contains no inline `#[test]` blocks. All 45
tests live in `main.rs` (`mock_store_seed_contains_cli_fixtures`,
`db_path_defaults_when_env_missing`, `db_path_uses_env_override`) and the
other subcommand modules (`list*`, `triage`, `sync_cmd`, `seed_requirements`).
Per task instruction, no bug report was filed.

## 2. `cargo clippy -p agileplus-cli --offline --all-targets -- -D warnings`

Result: **FAIL** — pre-existing clippy lint in `main.rs` (NOT in `worklog.rs`).

```
error: items after a test module
   --> crates/agileplus-cli/src/main.rs:226:1
    |
226 | mod tests {
    | ^^^^^^^^^
...
256 | async fn main() {
    |       ^^^^^^^^^
    |
    = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.95.0/index.html#items_after_test_module
    = note: `-D clippy::items-after-test-module` implied by `-D warnings`
    = help: to override `-D warnings` add `#[allow(clippy::items_after_test_module)]`
    = help: move the items to before the test module was defined

error: could not compile `agileplus-cli` (bin "agileplus-cli" test) due to 1 previous error
```

The `worklog` module (and its 273 lines) passed clippy cleanly. The single
lint is the `mod tests { ... }` block in `main.rs:226` followed by
`async fn main()` at `main.rs:256`. Per task instruction ("Do NOT modify the
worklog.rs code"), and the fact that the lint is outside the worklog
subcommand, this is left for a separate fix. The fix is a one-line `#[allow]`
or moving the items above the test module.

## 3. Binary subcommand outputs

### 3.1 `agileplus-cli worklog schema`

```
Canonical worklog schema (8 fields):
  1. status
  2. task_id
  3. agent_id
  4. files_changed
  5. commit_sha
  6. verification_result
  7. started_at
  8. completed_at
```

All 8 fields printed in declared order. Matches `CANONICAL_FIELDS` constant
at `crates/agileplus-cli/src/commands/worklog.rs:11-20`.

### 3.2 `agileplus-cli worklog list` (per focus repo)

| Repo | Files seen as "raw" | Files seen as "canonical" |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| AgilePlus | 6 (incl. 4 canonical) | 4 (canonical-only) |
| PhenoCompose | 2 (incl. 2 canonical) | 2 (canonical-only) |
| nanovms | 8 (incl. 4 canonical) | 4 (canonical-only) |
| PlayCua | 8 (incl. 5 canonical) | 5 (canonical-only) |
| BytePort | 7 (incl. 4 canonical) | 4 (canonical-only) |

`list` does enumerate all worklog files (raw + canonical), but the "Raw
worklogs" section header is misleading because the underlying
`find_worklogs(dir, false)` filter (`worklog.rs:258`) currently includes
both raw and canonical files. See issue #2 below. Final per-file counts
agree across `list` and `validate` because `validate` uses the same
bug-prone filter.

### 3.3 `agileplus-cli worklog validate` (per focus repo)

| Repo | Files checked | OK | FAIL | Exit |
|------|---------------|----|------|------|
| AgilePlus | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| PhenoCompose | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| nanovms | 8 | 6 | 2 | 1 |
| PlayCua | 8 | 5 | 3 | 1 |
| BytePort | 7 | 5 | 2 | 1 |

Sample FAIL output (AgilePlus L2-029 raw):

```
FAIL /Users/.../AgilePlus/worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11.json:
     missing task_id, agent_id, files_changed, commit_sha,
     verification_result, started_at, completed_at
```

The user's brief estimated "2 OK, 2 FAIL for the mixed-format worklogs".
Observed ratios vary per repo because not all "raw" files are equally raw:

- The `L2-029` and `L2-033` raw worklogs are missing most canonical fields
  (→ FAIL).
- The `L1-008-2026-06-11-retry.json` (nanovms, BytePort) is in a third
  shape: it has most canonical fields BUT `verification_result` is a free-
  form string instead of an object, and `commit_sha` is empty. Since all
  8 field names are present, it validates as **OK** even though
  semantically it does not match the canonical schema's type contract.
  See issue #4.
- The PhenoCompose L1-004/L1-009 worklogs are already canonical-only; no
  raw counterparts exist.

### 3.4 `agileplus-cli worklog convert` (per focus repo)

All 5 repos completed conversion. Sample (AgilePlus, 3 files):

```
Converting 3 worklog(s) in /Users/.../AgilePlus (in_place=false)
OK   worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11-canonical.json -> worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11-canonical-canonical.json
OK   worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11.json           -> worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11-canonical.json
OK   worklog-L2-033-2026-06-11-canonical.json -> worklog-L2-033-2026-06-11-canonical-canonical.json
```

Per-repo processed counts: AgilePlus 3, PhenoCompose 2, nanovms 8,
PlayCua 8, BytePort 7. All exits were 0.

Conversion semantics observations:

- `path_with_suffix` (`worklog.rs:266`) naively appends `-canonical.json`
  to any source filename. When the source is itself already canonical
  (`worklog-...-canonical.json`), the output is
  `worklog-...-canonical-canonical.json`. See issue #3.
- For raw sources (`worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11.json`), output is correctly
  `worklog-L2-029-2026-06-11-canonical.json` and matches the existing
  canonical file's field set (overwriting it).
- `to_canonical` (`worklog.rs:179`) handles the raw L2-029 / L2-033
  shapes correctly: `task` → `task_id`, `branch` → `commit_sha`,
  `date` → `completed_at`, `files` → `files_changed`. The
  `verification_result` field for raw files has no equivalent (e.g. the
  dependabot worklog's `validation` string), so it falls through to
  `VerificationResult::default()` (empty status/commands/notes) — not
  ideal but not a loss either.
- For the L1-008-retry shape (`verification_result` is a string), the
  `to_canonical` extraction (`worklog.rs:196-224`) only descends into
  objects; a string slips through to `Default::default()`. Output is
  still valid canonical (8 fields, all present).

## 4. Issues found (recommendation only — no code changes per task)

1. **`main.rs` clippy lint** — `items-after-test-module` at
   `crates/agileplus-cli/src/main.rs:226` (test module precedes `main`).
   Outside the worklog subcommand; flagged for a separate small fix.
   Severity: low. Fix: add `#[allow(clippy::items_after_test_module)]`
   or move `mod tests` after `main`.

2. **`find_worklogs` filter is too permissive** —
   `crates/agileplus-cli/src/commands/worklog.rs:250-264`. The condition
   `(canonical_only == is_canonical || (!canonical_only && is_canonical))`
   simplifies to `is_worklog && is_canonical` for `canonical_only = true`
   (correct) but for `canonical_only = false` it degenerates to
   `is_worklog` (no filter — all worklog files are returned, including
   canonical ones). Concrete effect:
   - `list`'s "Raw worklogs" header is a misnomer; the section contains
     every worklog file in the directory.
   - `validate` and `convert` (both call with `canonical_only = false`)
     process already-canonical files, which leads to issue #3.
   Fix: change the condition to
   `is_worklog && (canonical_only == is_canonical)` (XOR would also
   work; this is the intended `match canonical_only`).

3. **`path_with_suffix` produces `-canonical-canonical.json` for already-
   canonical sources** — `crates/agileplus-cli/src/commands/worklog.rs:266-273`.
   Combined with issue #2, `convert` on a directory that already has
   canonical files writes `…-canonical-canonical.json` next to every
   canonical file. The four other focus repos (PhenoCompose, nanovms,
   PlayCua, BytePort) now have these duplicate `*-canonical-canonical.json`
   files. They are valid canonical worklogs (just renamed) but visually
   noisy. Fix: either skip files where `is_canonical` is already true, or
   special-case `path_with_suffix` to detect an existing `-canonical`
   stem and overwrite in place.

4. **Validation is structural-only, not type-strict** —
   `crates/agileplus-cli/src/commands/worklog.rs:117-141` checks for
   presence of the 8 field names, not their types/shapes. The
   `L1-008-2026-06-11-retry.json` files in nanovms/BytePort have all
   8 keys but `verification_result` is a free-form string
   (`"PASS: env … go test …; BLOCKED: …"`) and `commit_sha` is `""`.
   Both are reported as `OK`. Acceptable as a first cut, but a real
   JSON-schema check (e.g. `jsonschema` crate) would catch these.

5. **Files missing from AgilePlus post-convert** — At the time of
   verification, AgilePlus contained only 3 worklog files
   (`L2-029-canonical`, `L2-029`, `L2-033-canonical`) while the original
   list output at the start of the session showed 6
   (also `L1-001-canonical`, `L1-006-canonical`, `L2-033`). The
   `L1-001-canonical.json` and `L1-006-canonical.json` files appear
   to have been removed by an external process between the initial
   `list` and the `convert` run; `L2-033-2026-06-11.json` is also gone.
   None of these are in `git ls-files` (untracked artifacts). Worth
   confirming whether a cleanup script or a parallel agent run did this.
