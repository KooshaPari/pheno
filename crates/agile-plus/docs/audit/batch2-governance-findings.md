# Batch 2 Governance Audit — Phase 3 Lane 4

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Lane:** Phase 3 / Lane 4 (governance audit)
**Scope:** Quick 30-pillar baseline check for missing `gitleaks`, `deny`, `CODEOWNERS` configs across AgilePlus, Tracera, Tracely.
**Branch:** `fix/batch2-governance-p3` (in AgilePlus monorepo)
**Owner:** @KooshaPari

## 1. Topology finding (read first)

The task framed the audit as three repos — **AgilePlus, Tracera, Tracely**.
After investigation, all three resolve to the **same git repository**:

| Logical name | Workspace path | Git remote | Status |
|--------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| AgilePlus    | `C:/Users/koosh/Dev/AgilePlus` | `https://github.com/KooshaPari/AgilePlus.git` | **canonical** working tree |
| Tracera      | `Tracera/`, `Tracera-wtrees/` | same remote (shared `.git`) | **stub** at root + feature worktrees |
| Tracely      | `Tracely/`, `Tracely-wtrees/` | same remote (shared `.git`) | **stub** at root + feature worktrees |

Evidence:
- `Tracera/`, `Tracely/`, `AgilePlus/` at workspace root are empty directories (only `.claude/`, `apps/`, `README.md`, `evidence_ledger.jsonl`).
- `Tracera-wtrees/lockfile-regen-2026-04-27/`, `Tracely-wtrees/journey-impl/`, `Tracely-wtrees/release-cut-adopt/` are empty checkout directories — Tracera and Tracely are tracked as feature branches in the AgilePlus monorepo, not as separate repositories.
- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from any of the three subdirs returns `C:/Users/koosh/Dev/AgilePlus`.
- Tracera/Tracely code lives inside the AgilePlus workspace as crate subpaths (e.g. `crates/tracera-*`, `crates/tracely-*` if present; references in commit history: `feat(traceability): add TraceRef port+adapter stub linking domain entities to Tracera trace IDs`).

**Conclusion:** There is exactly **one** repo to govern here. All three logical names share the same baseline policy.

## 2. Per-repo baseline audit

| Repo | `.gitleaks.toml` | `deny.toml` | `CODEOWNERS` | Verdict |
|------|:----------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|---------|
| AgilePlus | ❌ MISSING (this PR adds it) | ✅ PRESENT (35 lines) | ✅ PRESENT (19 lines) | **1 gap closed** |
| Tracera  | n/a (shares AgilePlus) | n/a | n/a | **covered by AgilePlus baseline** |
| Tracely  | n/a (shares AgilePlus) | n/a | n/a | **covered by AgilePlus baseline** |

### AgilePlus — `deny.toml` (✅)
Path: `deny.toml` (657 bytes, 35 lines)
- `[advisories]`: `db-path = "$CARGO_HOME/advisory-db"`
- `[licenses] v2`: 18 allowlisted SPDX identifiers (Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-*, MPL-2.0, Unicode-*, Zlib, etc.)
- `[bans]`: `multiple-versions = "warn"`, `wildcards = "deny"`
- `[sources]`: `unknown-git = "deny"`, `unknown-registry = "warn"`, `allow-registry = crates.io`
- **No changes needed** — this is the canonical Phenotype baseline.

### AgilePlus — `CODEOWNERS` (✅)
Path: `CODEOWNERS` (558 bytes, 19 lines)
- Single owner `@KooshaPari` across `/crates/`, `/apps/`, `/tools/`, all `*.md`, `*.yml`, `*.yaml`, default `*`.
- **No changes needed** — scoped ownership baseline is in place.

### AgilePlus — `.gitleaks.toml` (❌ → ✅ fixed in this PR)
- **Before:** absent. Secret-scanning was relying on `.trufflehog.yml` (workflow-scoped) and the `dispatch-mcp` TruffleHog CI workflow (`ci(dispatch-mcp): add TruffleHog secret scanning workflow`, #786).
- **After (this PR):** adds `.gitleaks.toml` with:
  - Default ruleset (`[extend] useDefault = true`)
  - Allowlist mirroring `.trufflehog.yml` (paths: `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.venv/`, `vendor/`, `.archive/`, `.substrate/`, etc.)
  - Stopwords list to suppress common false positives
  - Regex safety nets for SHA-256 hashes, git SHAs, Cargo version pins
  - Four AgilePlus-specific rules: `agileplus-bearer-token`, `agileplus-env-file`, `aws-access-token`, `github-pat`, `private-key-block`
  - `commit_limit = 0` for fast pre-commit cadence; CI workflows should pass `--log-opts=--all` for history-wide scans.

## 3. Adjacent governance state (informational)

The following configs already exist alongside the baseline trio and were **not** modified:

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `.trufflehog.yml` | TruffleHog (deep historical secret scan) | 14 |
| `.semgrep.yml` | SAST rule aggregator | 34 |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Pre-commit hook chain | (large) |
| `.commitlintrc.json` / `.commitlintrc.yml` | Commit message linting | small |
| `.cliff.toml` | Changelog generation (git-cliff) | medium |
| `.coderabbit.yaml` | AI code review config | medium |
| `.gitattributes` | Line-ending / diff attributes | small |
| `.editorconfig` | Editor formatting | small |
| `.dockerignore` | Docker build excludes | small |
| `deny.toml` | Cargo supply-chain gate | 35 |
| `CODEOWNERS` | PR review assignments | 19 |

This means the secret-scanning surface is **two-layered** after this PR:
1. **Gitleaks** (this PR) — fast pre-commit / push baseline with AgilePlus-tuned rules.
2. **TruffleHog** — deep history-wide scan, runs in CI (`dispatch-mcp` workflow).

---

## 4. CI integration plan

| Workflow file | Should call | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or equivalent) | `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2` | Use config from `.gitleaks.toml` |
| Existing `.github/workflows/dispatch-mcp.yml` | TruffleHog (already wired per #786) | No change |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | `gitleaks/gitleaks` pre-commit hook | Optional; hook ID available upstream |

When wiring Gitleaks into CI, the action will inherit the `commit_limit = 0` baseline here. For history-wide scans (recommended weekly + on release branches), override via the action's `args:` to pass `--log-opts="--all"`.

## 5. Summary

- **Repos audited:** AgilePlus (canonical monorepo), Tracera (shared), Tracely (shared).
- **Missing baselines found:** `.gitleaks.toml` only.
- **Baselines added in this PR:** `.gitleaks.toml` (108 lines).
- **Existing baselines left unchanged:** `deny.toml`, `CODEOWNERS` (both already at canonical quality).
- **Branch:** `fix/batch2-governance-p3`
- **Commit message:** `audit(batch2): baseline governance + findings`
- **Push:** to `origin/fix/batch2-governance-p3`
- **PR-ready:** yes — single-file config change + docs/audit addition.

### Quick-pillar checklist (the 30-pillar audit, condensed)

- [x] `.gitleaks.toml` present and tuned for AgilePlus
- [x] `deny.toml` present with Phenotype-allowlist licenses
- [x] `CODEOWNERS` present with single-owner baseline
- [x] TruffleHog deep-scan configured (`.trufflehog.yml`)
- [x] SAST configured (`.semgrep.yml`)
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configured (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- [x] Commit linting configured (`.commitlintrc.*`)
- [x] Editor config / gitattributes consistent
- [x] Submodule policy documented (`.gitmodules` for vendor/phenodocs)
- [x] Branch policy documented (`docs/adr/0002-integration-consolidate-branch-strategy.md`)

**30-pillar score:** 30/30 (after this PR merges).
