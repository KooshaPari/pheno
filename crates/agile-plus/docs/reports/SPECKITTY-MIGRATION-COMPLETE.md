## 1. What shipped

The migration lands as **three stacked PRs**, in order. Each is
independently revertable and locally verifiable.

| PR    | Title                                                          | Branch                  | Commit   | Tests added |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| #901  | SpecKitty → AgilePlus: scoring engine + ap rubric + 14 shims   | `feat/speckitty-migration`  | `eef51a8` | +135 (workspace indexmap + trait-sig drift + list_tests.rs) |
| #902  | rubric v2 — content-probe rule registry + --probes CLI flag    | `feat/rubric-v2-probes`     | `3fcad6b` | +12 (probes + integration)                                    |
| #903  | ap cockpit publish — NDJSON rubric scorecards                  | `feat/cockpit-publish`      | `b55ad98` | +9 (5 unit + 4 integration)                                   |

### 1.1 PR #901 — scoring engine + ap rubric

- **`crates/agileplus-governance/src/scoring_engine.rs`** (597 → 597 lines at merge): the orchestrator that consumes a `RubricCatalog` + `RepoScan` and emits v38-formatted scorecards. Path-presence rule registry (`SCORING_RULES`) keyed by cluster/pillar ids, with hard-coded paths.
- **`crates/agileplus-cli/src/commands/rubric.rs`**: CLI subcommand group; `ap rubric score --repo <path> [--catalog <PILLARS-CATALOG.json>] [--clusters C03,C10,C11] [--output <file>]`. Resolves the bundled catalog by walking up to the cargo workspace root.
- **Cursor shim redirects** (14 files under `.cursor/commands/spec-kitty.*.md`): each shim is reduced from ~15 KB prose to a 2-line redirect that names the canonical `ap <cmd>` successor. Total: ~3 000 LOC deleted from cursor surface; ~1 400 LOC added to AgilePlus surface.
- **Spec mapping**: `docs/design/SPECKITTY-MIGRATION.md` lists the 14 concept → `ap` mappings (specify → `ap rubric`, research → `ap rubric score --clusters C00`, status → `ap cockpit publish` (post #903), etc.).

### 1.2 PR #902 — content-probe rule registry (rubric v2)

- **`ProbeRule` struct** + `SCORING_PROBES` const: 7 built-in content-probe rules across **C01 / C04 / C05 / C08 / C11**, each matching a regex against a target file's contents rather than its existence.
- **`evaluate_with_probes(...)`**: new orchestrator entry that wraps `evaluate(...)` and adds a +1 probe-bonus clamped at `ClusterScore.score: u32` max=3. Backwards-compat: `evaluate()` unchanged.
- **`--probes {auto, none, all}`** flag on `ap rubric score`. Default `auto` (use the built-in catalog); `none` reverts to v1 path-presence behavior.
- **+12 tests**: catalog invariants (≥5 probes, ≥1 per required cluster, every rule compiles), probe collection w/ file:line excerpts, missing-file silent fallback, probe-bonus clamp, v1-equivalence under `Some(&[])`, default-probes citation.

### 1.3 PR #903 — `ap cockpit publish`

- **`ap cockpit {publish, path}`**: new CLI subcommand group. `publish --repo <path> --output <PATH>` (default `~/.agileplus/cockpit.ndjson`) scores a repo and appends one NDJSON record per cluster to the log. `path` prints the resolved default log path.
- **NDJSON schema** (line-delimited JSON, one record per cluster):
  ```json
  {"ts":"epoch:1783295080","repo":"agileplus-cli","cluster":"C03","score":2,"max":3,"grade":"C","probes":1}
  ```
- **`evaluate_with_probes` integration**: TODO(`rubric-v2`) marker inside `publish()` calls out the one-line switch from `evaluate` → `evaluate_with_probes` once PR #902 lands on `main`. Until then, every record reports `probes: 0`.
- **+9 tests**: NDJSON round-trip, parent-dir auto-create, grade cutoffs (`A/B/C/D/F`), probe hit-count extraction, append-on-second-invocation, help text.

## 2. Local-verifiable gate

Reproduce in any of the three worktrees (`p5-closeout`, `rubric-v2-probes`, `cockpit-publish`):

```
cargo test -p agileplus-cli          # 217 unit + integration tests, 0 failures
cargo test -p agileplus-governance   #  38 unit + doctests, 0 failures
cargo run -p agileplus-cli --bin agileplus -- rubric score \
  --repo crates/agileplus-cli --clusters C01,C04 --probes auto
cargo run -p agileplus-cli --bin agileplus -- cockpit publish \
  --repo crates/agileplus-cli --output /tmp/cockpit.ndjson
```

Wired-GitHub CI is **billed-out** (per the persistent
`KooshaPari/AgilePlus` Actions spending-limit failure visible in
PR #901's statusCheckRollup). Local verification is the contract.

## 3. Cursor-side decommissioning

Effective on merge of #901 the cursor shims under `.cursor/commands/`
were physically reduced from full prompts to redirect stubs. They are
still present (so the IDE doesn't crash on a missing command) but
no longer contain runnable agent guidance:

| SpecKitty command     | Cursor shim file                     | Canonical successor                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `spec-kitty.research` | `.cursor/commands/spec-kitty.research.md` | `ap rubric score --repo <path> --clusters C00` |
| `spec-kitty.review`   | `.cursor/commands/spec-kitty.review.md`   | `ap rubric score --repo <path> --clusters C03` |
| `spec-kitty.specify`  | `.cursor/commands/spec-kitty.specify.md`  | `ap rubric score --repo <path>` + `ap cockpit publish` |
| `spec-kitty.status`   | `.cursor/commands/spec-kitty.status.md`   | `ap cockpit publish` (NDJSON tail → `ap cockpit reader` once #41 lands) |
| `spec-kitty.tasks`    | `.cursor/commands/spec-kitty.tasks.md`    | `ap rubric fix-list --repo <path>` (post #22) |
| ... 9 more           | see PR #901 diff                    | see PR #901 diff                           |

**Action required of operators**: replace `spec-kitty.<cmd>` invocations
in agent prompts with `ap <cmd>`. The shims will be deleted in a
follow-up PR once we have ≥30 days of zero agent usage on the `.kittify/`
artifacts directory (tracking memory: `project_agileplus_speckitty_replacement`).

## 4. Re-audit against v38

Quick pass of `ap rubric score` against the new `AgilePlus` repo
post-#901 (intentionally small subset; full C00-C11 sweep is task #19,
deferred until rubric v2 lands):

| Cluster | Pillars  | Score | Grade | Probe-evidence | Notes |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ----- | --------------- | ----- |
| C01     | L10-L19  | 1/3   | F (33%) | (none) | CI/DX baseline: README, no full denoised CI workflow under workspace root |
| C02     | L0-L9    | (deferred) | – | – | full sweep pending PR #902 |
| C03     | L20-L29  | (deferred) | – | – | FR/NFR + llms.txt path-presence |
| C04     | L31-L40  | 0/3   | F (0%) | (none) | gitleaks/trufflehog missing from this re-audit's surface |

Full v38 re-audit to be filed in `audit/.lane-c00-c02/` post #902.

## 5. Cross-domain handoffs

| Teammate | Lane | What they need from me | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cockpit-mesh | `ap cockpit reader` (task #41) | NDJSON schema = `{ts, repo, cluster, score, max, grade, probes}` (locked by PR #903) | `docs/reports/SPECKITTY-MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md` §1.3 |
| sharecli / substrate | not affected | – | – |
| vision-pillar | `feat/agileplus-splash` | out-of-scope per team domain split | (their branch) |
| phenofleet | `FLEET_DAG_v3.db` | the `cockpit.ndjson` shape above slots into the fleet scorecard reader unchanged | `~/.agileplus/cockpit.ndjson` |

## 6. Deferred / Follow-on

Per the task list at session start these PRs spawn the next domain lanes:

1. **C00–C02 scorecard sweep** (task #19, 18 scorecards × 6 owned repos): blocked on PR #902 landing. Will run from a fresh `c00-c02-sweep` worktree using `ap rubric score --probes auto` + `--clusters C00,C01,C02`. Scorecards land in `<repo>/audit/.lane-c{00,01,02}/C{NN}.md`.
2. **`ap rubric fix-list`** (task #22, in-flight): reads the 18 C00–C02 scorecards and emits a top-10 prioritized fix list per repo.
3. **Probe-evidence coupling**: post PR #902 merge, switch `ap cockpit publish` from `evaluate` to `evaluate_with_probes`, drop the `probes: 0` placeholder, re-test.

## 7. Risks / Open Items

- **CI gating gap**: GitHub Actions billing is exhausted per the persistent Actions spending-limit failure. Local-gate + admin-squash is the de-facto merge contract until a billing fix lands. Auditors should not rely on green-CI alone — read the PR diff.
- **Cursor-shim residue**: 14 thin redirect stubs under `.cursor/commands/`. They cost ~3 KB total but signal "SpecKitty is gone" to anyone grepping the repo. Removal is gated on a usage observation window (≥30 days of zero agent hits on `.kittify/`).
- **Catalog-PILLARS drift**: `crates/agileplus-governance/data/PILLARS-CATALOG.json` is bundled. It is regenerated whenever `kitty-specs/003-agileplus-platform-completion/` changes; the git diff should always include the catalog alongside any L-number churn.
- **`probes: 0` fallback**: cockpit records report `probes: 0` until PR #902 merges. Dashboards consuming the log should treat missing/zero probe counts as equivalent, not as a real signal.

## 8. Update provenance

- Original design doc: `docs/design/SPECKITTY-MIGRATION.md` (Tier 1, hand-authored) — kept as the concept-mapping SSOT.
- This completion report: Tier 1 (agent-authored, hand-edited).
- Next lifecycle: §6 follow-on tasks scheduled in the team DAG. **No further edits expected to this report unless the migration is rolled back or a v3 scoring engine ships.**
