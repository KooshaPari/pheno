## Security Best Practices for Users

### Dependencies

Keep dependencies up to date:

```bash
# Rust (Cargo)
cargo audit

# Python (pip)
pip-audit

# Node.js (npm)
npm audit
```

- Rotate credentials regularly

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries (prevent injection attacks)
- Implement rate limiting

## Security Tools Used

|------|---------|
| cargo-audit | Rust dependency vulnerability scanning |
| pip-audit | Python dependency vulnerability scanning |
| npm audit | Node.js dependency vulnerability scanning |
| CodeQL | Static analysis security testing |
| Dependabot | Automated dependency updates |
