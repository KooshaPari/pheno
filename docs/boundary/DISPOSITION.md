# pheno — Per-Module Boundary Disposition

**Status:** Assessment
**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Charter:** [`phenotype-registry/docs/rationalization/boundary-shaping.md`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenotype-registry/blob/main/docs/rationalization/boundary-shaping.md)
**Repo assessed:** [KooshaPari/pheno](https://github.com/KooshaPari/pheno) — Rust mega-monorepo + organizational "shelf"
**Charter's pre-classification of this repo:** *"170K LOC, 11 workspaces — Decompose by workspace into domain repos / existing *Kits; keep only too-small bits."*

> **Doctrine reminder (verbatim from charter):** A stub / empty / broken / unused / incomplete module is **not** a delete candidate by default. On-paper-good boundaries still deserve an owner. For each module/crate/folder pick ONE: **(1) DECOMPOSE**, **(2) ABSORB**, **(3) DYNAMIC-KEEP**. **No deletions** — every entry below gets an owner or stays in a dynamic-install monorepo.

| # | Module | What it is | Disp. | Target repo | Rationale |
|---|--------|-----------|:-----:|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | `crates/` | Rust workspace, 60+ infra + agileplus + phenotype-* crates (the bulk of "pheno") | **D** | split per-crate → domain SDKs / phenoShared (see §2) | Charter: "pheno 170K LOC, 11 workspaces — Decompose by workspace." Largest signal in repo. |

| 3 | `rust/` | Rust apps sub-workspace (`src/`) | **D** | move apps out to their owning repos (Dino, Helix, …) | Apps belong with their platform, not in pheno. |
| 4 | `apps/` | Single sub-project `apps/byteport` (Go) | **D** | new repo `byteport` (or `phenotype-byteport`) | A standalone Go service should not live as a sub-dir of a Rust shelf. |

See §2 for the per-crate outline.

### 2.1 Where each major workspace lands

| From `pheno` (today) | To (end-state) | Owner disposition |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `crates/` (60+ Rust crates) | split per-crate → domain SDKs and `phenoShared` | **DECOMPOSE** by crate; see §2.2 |

| `kits/`, `packages/`, `libs/` (sub-trees), `pheno-cli`, `phenosdk`, `phenoSDK` | per-language SDK umbrellas (`phenotype-python-sdk`, `phenotype-typescript-sdk`, `phenotype-go-sdk`) | **DECOMPOSE** into per-language SDKs |
| `phenotype-types`, small cross-cutting type defs | `phenoShared` (dynamic-install monorepo) | **DYNAMIC-KEEP** |

### 2.3 Net result for `pheno`

- **Goes away** as a mega-monorepo (charter: *"decompose by workspace"*).
- **Becomes** a small "shell-archive" repo whose only role is to point at the now-scattered repos, OR is fully deprecated once every project has a canonical repo and `HexaKit` carries the scaffolding.
- **No deletions occur** during the move — every project gets a destination repo, every crate gets a destination crate/repo, and the `pheno` shell is retained as a redirector until all README/CLAUDE links are migrated.

## 3. Target Topology Reference (from charter, verbatim)

> *"HexaKit = project + file **templates / generators** that bootstrap new repos onto our arch patterns. NOT a lib holder. Owns the infra-generic layer (tests/CI/governance) as generated, tailorable scaffolding."*
> Domain SDKs: **McpKit · AuthKit→Authvault · ResilienceKit · TestingKit · PhenoObservability · phenotype-gfx**
> Umbrella: `phenoSDK`-style meta (dynamic install/import of the domain SDKs)
> Too-small monorepo: **`phenoShared`** (dynamic install)

For `pheno` specifically the charter says:

> *"pheno | 170K LOC, 11 workspaces | Rust mega-monorepo | **Decompose** by workspace into domain repos / existing *Kits; keep only too-small bits."*

This document delivers that assessment.

## 4. Execution Order (per charter)

> *"Per repo: assessment job → per-module disposition table → history-preserving move PRs → archive emptied shells only after relocation."*

1. **Now (this PR):** per-module disposition table — ✅ this document.
2. **Next PRs:** one history-preserving move PR per receiving repo, in this order:
   1. `HexaKit` first (so generated scaffolding replaces the root `.toml`/`.yml`/`.lock` files).
   2. `phenoShared` (consume the too-small crates from `crates/`).
   3. Domain SDKs in charter order: `McpKit` → `AuthKit`/`Authvault` → `ResilienceKit` → `TestingKit` → `PhenoObservability` → `phenotype-gfx`.
   4. Standalone product repos (one per top-level app dir).
   5. `agileplus` consolidation (last, biggest blast radius).
3. **After all moves land:** archive the `pheno` shell repo (rename to `pheno-archive`) so old links still resolve to a redirect.

**End of disposition.** No deletions. Every module above has an owner.
